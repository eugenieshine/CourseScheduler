1. API Indroduction
https://schoolofdata.org/2013/11/18/web-apis-for-non-programmers/

A good way to access UBC Registration webs, but in limited ways if data are protected

Implication:
Paramters - used for looking for a specific course


2. Found this on GitHub, wondering if it is useful (looks useful though)

3. Web Scraping Tutorial in PHP
http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/scenarios/scrape/

Bad news: Does that mean we have to use php as well?
Good news: after we get the data, we can save it to a file and use it from then

Recommend: double check how the web scraping is done in Mind the Gap project
